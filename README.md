# Corporate Communication Systems Management

## Overview
This repository contains the design and implementation plan for a comprehensive Corporate Communication Systems Management network. The project involves creating a functional schematic of the network infrastructure, recommendations for potential restructuring, a single unified network diagram, and an analysis of risks, benefits, and Return on Investment (RoI).

## Files
- **network_design.pkt**: The Packet Tracer file with the network design.
- Network Design and Detail.docx : The document file with details and all work information.
- **README.md**: This file.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `network_design.pkt` file using Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. Refer to the `README.md` file & `Document` file for detailed information on the assignment and tasks.

## Key Components

### Network Infrastructure

#### Floor 1: Management and Admin Team
- Computers/Workstations
- Printers and Scanners
- IP Phones
- Secure Wi-Fi Access Points

#### Floor 3: Sales and Support Team
- Computers/Workstations
- VoIP Phones and Headsets
- Secure Wi-Fi Access Points
- Printers

#### Floor 4: Marketing Team
- Computers/Workstations
- Creative Studios
- Printers and Plotters
- Secure Wi-Fi Access Points

#### Warehouse
- Industrial Wi-Fi Access Points
- Shipping and Receiving Stations

#### Core Network
- **Floor 2: Infrastructure and Operations (Main IT Hub)**
  - Core Switch (Cisco Catalyst 9500 Series)
  - Servers (Dell PowerEdge R740)
  - Firewall and Routers (Cisco ASA 5500-X, Cisco 4000 Series)
  - Network Security Systems
  - WLAN Controller (Cisco 3504 Wireless Controller)

## Recommendations for Restructuring

### Broadband Requirements for WFH Users
- Minimum 25 Mbps download and 5 Mbps upload
- SLA with 99.9% uptime
- 24/7 customer support
- VPN capabilities

### Minimizing Computing Infrastructure
- Cloud Migration
- Virtualization
- SD-WAN Deployment
- Fail-Over Provisions

### On-Site Infrastructure Modifications
- Core Switch as central hub
- Updated Firewall
- Reduced number of WLAN Access Points
- Server Consolidation and Virtualization

## Risks and Benefits

### Risks
- **Technical Risks**: Integration issues, transition downtime, new security vulnerabilities
- **Business Risks**: Budget overruns, business disruptions, employee adjustment to new technologies

### Benefits
- **Technical Benefits**: Improved system performance, enhanced security, increased flexibility
- **Business Benefits**: Reduced long-term costs, competitive advantage, support for remote workforce

## RoI Snapshot
- Savings from reduced on-site infrastructure and maintenance
- Expected positive RoI within 2-3 years post-implementation
- Gains from improved productivity and customer satisfaction
